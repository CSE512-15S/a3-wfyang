## Empirical Knight Move Probabilities

In order to visualize the empirical distribution of move choices by chess players for a knight from a given square, I have created an interactive chess board to view the probability of a given move on the board itself.  When a square is clicked on the main board, the squares where a knight can legally move are hi-lighted and display the conditional probability of moving to that target square conditional on the clicked position.  Below the main board, there are two smaller boards where the corresponding conditional probabilities are displayed for two famous grandmasters: Bobby Fischer and Magnus Carlsen.  At the top of the visualization, users may opt to show all the games, show only the losses, or show only the wins and draws.

The data used in the main board is from the Free Internet Chess System games database.  I used all standard games (15 minutes a side) played in 2014 with an average FICS rating greater than 2000.  The data is available in pgn format here at http://www.ficsgames.org/download.html .

The Magnus Carlsen data is available at http://www.magnuscarlsenchess.com/games.php

The Bobby Fischer data was obtained from http://www.chess.com/download/view/the-complete-career-of-bobby-fischer

## Running Instructions

The visualization will be available online at TO BE UPLOADED.
